Let $\pi_{0},\pi_{C},\pi_{H},$ and $\pi_{CH}$ denote the long-term probabilities for each state. They can be determined by setting the long-term states in and out of each state equal to each other:
$$
\begin{align}
	10\pi_{0} & =2\pi_{C}+5\pi_{H}, \\
(5+2)\pi_{C} & =5\pi_{CH}+10\pi_{0}, \\
5\pi_{H} & =2\pi_{CH}, \\
(5+2)\pi_{CH} & =5\pi_{C}, \\
1 & =\pi_{0}+\pi_{C}+\pi_{H}+\pi_{CH}
\end{align}
$$

From equations 3 and 4 we have $\pi_{H}=\frac{2}{5}\pi_{CH}$ and $\pi_{C}=\frac{7}{5}\pi_{CH}$. Substituting these into equations 1 and 5 reduces the system to

$$
\begin{align*}
	10\pi_{0} & =2\left( \frac{7}{5}\pi_{CH} \right) +5 \left( \frac{2}{5} \pi_{CH}\right), \\
1 & =\pi_{0}+\frac{7}{5}\pi_{CH}+\frac{2}{5}\pi_{CH}+\pi_{CH},
\end{align*}
$$

Simplify and solve:

$$
\begin{align*}
	10\pi_{0} & =\frac{24}{5}\pi_{CH}, \\
1 & =\pi_{0}+\frac{14}{5}\pi_{CH}.
\end{align*}
$$

$$
1=\frac{24}{50}\pi _{CH}+\frac{140}{50}\pi_{CH}=\frac{164}{50}\pi_{CH}
$$
