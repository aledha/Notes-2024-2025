There are three types of muscle cells; skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and smooth muscle. 
Each muscle cell consists of several cylindrical structures called *myofibrils*, which consists of individual contractile units called *sarcomeres*. The sarcomeres, depicted in figure \ref{}, consists of thin filaments and thick filaments. The thin filaments contain the proteins *actin*, *tropomyosin*, and *troponin C*,  while the thick filaments contain the protein *myosin*. For a muscle to contract, myosin must bind to actin to form whats known as a *crossbridge*, which bends in order to pull the thin filament along the thick filament. The bending of the crossbridge is called a *power stroke*. 

The tropomyosin form the backbone of a double-stranded helix that both the actin and troponin are bound to. Troponin blocks the binding sites on the actin, preventing the forming of a crossbridge. When the intracellular calcium concentration is high, troponin binds to calcium ions and allow the forming of a crossbridge.

The cell membrane has several ion channels that are voltage dependent. When the action potential reaches a cell, the calcium ion channels are opened, which results in a higher intracellular concentration of calcium. 

There are three main stages in muscle activation: the action potential (which will be discussed in Section \ref{sec:}), the calcium ion transient, and the contraction \cite{mathphys}.
