* **Contraction mechanism:** Calcium ions are released into cells as a result from the triggering of the action potential. This allows the thin filament, actin, and the thick filament, myosin, to bind, which forms what is called a *cross-bridge*. 
* **PV-Loop**: During one cardiac cycle, one can measure the volume of the left ventricle on one axis, and the pressure on the other to illustrate the pressure-volume relationship during a cycle.

 
* **Isovolumoic contraction**: During end-diastole (ED), the mitral valve closes such that the ventricle is fully closed. Then, the ventricle contracts, which increases the pressure. When the pressure exceeds the *aortic pressure*, the aortic valve opens, allowing the high-pressurized blood to flow to the rest of the body.
* **Isovolumic relaxation**: When the pressure drops below the *aortic pressure* after the sufficient blood has flowed out of the ventricle, the aortic valve closes again. The ventricle is fully closed and relaxes, decreasing the pressure. When the pressure drops below the *atrial pressure*, the mitral valve opens and allows oxygenated blood to flow into the ventricle.

The process from the start of the isovolumic contraction until the closing of the aortic valve is called *systole*.
The process from the start of isovolumic relaxation until the closing of the mitral valve is called *diastole*.

* **End-diastolic pressure volume relationship (EDPVR)** is the relationship between the pressure and volume during the inactive state (no contraction in the myocardium)
*  **End-systolic pressure volume relationship (ESPVR)** is the relationship between the pressure and volume during the active state (full contraction in the myocardium)
