We are interested in modeling the concentration of ions in the cell, specifically the intracellular calcium concentration $[\text{Ca}^{2+}]_{i}$, which is related to the active tension $T_{a}$ with the Land model described in \autoref{}. For an ion $S$, we denote the intracellular and extracellular concentration as $[S]_{i}$ and $[S]_{e}$, respectively. These concentrations are separated by the cell membrane, which prevents direct diffusion. The membrane contains ion channels that allow diffusion of a specific ion, as depicted in \autoref{}. While there are several types of channels, we will discuss $\textit{leakage channels}$ and $\textit{voltage-gated channels}$. Leakage channels are continuously open, while voltage-gated channels opens and closes in response to the transmembrane voltage $v$. The transmembrane voltage is conventionally defined to be the difference of the intracellular potential $v_{i}$ and the extracellular potential $v_{e}$:
$$
\begin{equation}
v=v_{i}-v_{e}.
\end{equation}
$$

First, consider a situation where the
